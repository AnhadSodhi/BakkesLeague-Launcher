# BakkesLeague-Launcher
A .bat file to launch both Bakkesmod and Rocket League, allowing your plugins and game to both load in just one click.

It is mapped to the default installation locations for both Bakkesmod and Rocket League.
If your Bakkesmod and/or Rocket League is not installed in these locations:
Step-by-step:
* Copy the path of the folder containing Bakkesmod.exe or RocketLeague.exe.
* Open launcher .bat by right-clicking and clicking "open with notepad".
* In launcher.bat, change cd /d "C:\Program Files\BakkesMod" for the proper Bakkesmod folder or cd /d "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64" for the proper Rocket League folder to cd /d "YOUR_PATH_HERE".
* Save launcher .bat with ctrl+s.
TLDR: Replace the corresponding file paths in launcher.bat with cd /d "YOUR_PATH_HERE".
