A .bat file to launch both Bakkesmod and Rocket League, allowing your plugins and game to both load in just one click. No installation or setup required!

## How do I install this thing?
### My Bakkesmod and Rocket League are installed in the default folders
* Download launcher.bat and double click on it to launch Bakkesmod and Rocket League.
### My Bakkesmod and Rocket League are NOT installed in the default folders/I am not sure
* Download setup.bat and run it (it may take a few seconds to finish running). It will create a launcher.bat with the correct file paths. Double click on launcher.bat to launch Bakkesmod and Rocket League.

If you changed the file paths after setting up, have no fear! Simply run setup.bat again and it will give you a new, updated launcher.bat.
